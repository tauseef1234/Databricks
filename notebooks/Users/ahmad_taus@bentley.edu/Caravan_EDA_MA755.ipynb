This is an imbalanced dataset as the target variable Caravan Insurance Purchased has more 0’s i.e. the customers did not purchase the insurance policy as compared to 1’s i.e. the customers did purchase the insurance policy.  Futhermore, this dataset is set up as groups and each observation represent a large sample size.\nThere are 86 variables, containing sociodemographic data (variables 1-43) and product ownership data (variables 44-86).

We use correlation values at the first step to filter out the significant variables required for the analyses. The selected variables were uncorrelated with each other. Random forests technique was used to identify any other insignificant variables for prediction. This resulted in elimination of other insignificant variables. Some of the important factors using the random forest analyses were #fire policies, #car policies, #life insurances, #boat policies, other third-party insurances, income level and purchasing power.\n\nThen we further drilled down to see how the final shortlisted variables vary with the dependent variable. We used bi-variate analyses including visualizations and frequency reports to see how these independent variables varied with the dependent variable."],"metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"name":"Caravan_EDA_MA755","notebookId":197891},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
