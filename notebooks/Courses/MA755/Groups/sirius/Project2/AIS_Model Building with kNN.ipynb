Introduction"],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["The objective of this notebook is to use a pipeline that transforms the data step by step and performs the `kNN Regression` estimator. Each step of the pipeline is explained how additional features are appended to the data and then aggregated at the date level. The new features include lags, window features, datetime features, location features and status features. In this notebook, the daily oil price change has been added as an external feature. Each feature is generated using different classes. The last step of the pipeline applies an estimator to variables created from the previous steps for predicting the `Average` shipping fares. We performed grid search to find the best hyperparameters for kNN. Then, we build the model using the train data and make predictions to evaluate our model performance on the train and test dataset. The model performance is measured using the `RMSE` and the `Explained Variance`."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Below are the analyses steps that I specifically worked on during the model building phase:\n\n__Defining `AddLocationAndAggregate` class:__\n\n- Researched on geopy, reverse_geocode packages to find the location using a set of coordinates. Added location columns `City`, `Country` and `country_code` using latitude and longitude coordinates \n- Identified the outlier longitudinal values present in the dataset using visualizations and capped the outlier longitudinal values to 180\n-  The number of ships at each location was a key predictor for shipping fares. \n     - In order to extract the above information, I binarized the `Status` and the `Country` variables before aggregation\n- Next step was to get the data available at the unique date level \n     - Grouped the data by `Date` and `Average` and aggregated other variables by the sum\n- Aggregated output of the `Country` column tells the number of ships at that location\n- Separately, grouped `Date` and aggregate the `dwt` variable by the mean\n- Merge the two aggregated outputs to prepare the data at the unique day level for prediction \n     - Concatenated the last two steps and return the concatenated dataframe as output\n     \n- Applied the same set of steps for both train and test data\n\n\n__Defining `ExternalFeatures` class__:\n- Researched on external features affecting the shipping fares. Checked online resources/research papers to identify the external factors affecting the shipping fares. Included oil prices as an external predictor from an external data source\n\n- The data source provides the daily price of the crude stream traded at Cushing, Oklahoma, which is used as a benchmark in oil pricing (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DCOILWTICO)\n\n- Downloaded oil prices for the train and test data time periods separately and appended them to the aggregated data at unique date level\n\n\n__Defining `ResetIndex` class__:\n\n- Before applying the kNN estimator in the pipeline, this class resets the index and removes the index column\n\n\n__Grid Search__:\n\n- After the first model iteration with kNN, used Grid-Search to build a model on each parameter combination possible. The function iterates through every parameter combination and stores a model for each combination\n- Parameters varied: k nearest neighbors, number of cross-folds and number of jobs in parallel\n\nAs part of a group project, all the three members worked collaboratively understanding each section of the notebook."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#Summary of the Analyses steps\n\n__1.

The pipeline uses all of the classes defined in the previous notebook to process the data. This phase happens in the first seven steps where new features are added including the oil price, the data is aggregated at date level, lag and window features are created and NA values are removed. Each of the steps that transform the data into the desired form are explained in the first part of the notebook. Before the estimator, we scale the data using the Standard Scaler.  Next, we perform the grid search using a range of 1 to 30 for k values and 10 folds for cross validation. Using the best parameters from the grid search, we fit the `KNN regression` model to the scaled train data. When we evaluated the model performance in train set, the explained variance appeared to be 0.8842 while the RMSE was 0.3947. This model has a high R square and high RMSE for the train model in this dataset. The most important fact is how this model performs on unseen data. So, we tested the model performance on the test dataset and got a variance score of 0.19 and RMSE value of 0.899. Higher RMSE and lower variance might indicate that this model does not perform well. \n\n__Next steps:__\n\n- Try new data transformations to improve the model fit. \n- Analyze external factors including gdp, inflation and demand far raw materials\n- Use dimension reduction to find the combine the ship locations with similar attributes\n- Fit other modeling techniques including Linear Regression and Random Forest"],"metadata":{}}],"metadata":{"name":"AIS_Model Building with kNN","notebookId":402082},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
