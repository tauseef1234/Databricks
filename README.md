# ML Projects MSBA - Bentley University

This repo showcases the two group ML projects that I worked on during my master's course at Bentley University.

## Project 1
Caravan Insurance - The caravan insurance dataset supplied by the Dutch data mining company Sentient Machine Research and is based on a real-world business problem. The purpose of the project is to have a clear insight to why customers have a caravan policy and how these customers are different from the others.

## Project 2
