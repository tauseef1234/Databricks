# ML Projects MSBA - Bentley University

This repo showcases the two group ML projects that I worked on during my master's course at Bentley University.

## Project 1
Caravan Insurance - The caravan insurance dataset supplied by the Dutch data mining company Sentient Machine Research and is based on a real-world business problem. The purpose of the project is to have a clear insight to why customers have a caravan policy and how these customers are different from the others.

## Project 2
AIS - Vessel traffic data, or Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, are collected by the U.S. Coast Guard through an onboard navigation safety device that transmits and monitors the location and characteristics of large vessels in U.S. and international waters in real time. In the U.S., the Coast Guard and commercial vendors collect AIS data, which can also be used for a variety of coastal planning purposes. As part of capstone project, the AIS (vessel traffic data) was provided by a startup company to predict the average shipping fares for the future time period.
